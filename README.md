# DeepChief — Finance Autonomy OS

<img src="dc-150.png" alt="DeepChief logo" width="150" />

**One-liner:** Close continuously, control automatically, explain every number, and turn cash faster — with receipts.

---

## Why DeepChief

Finance teams juggle spreadsheets, task trackers, screenshots, and point tools. DeepChief replaces that month-end scramble with **policy-as-code**, **multi-agent execution**, and **signed evidence receipts** so every action is traceable, auditable, and explainable.

**Who it’s for:** CFOs, Controllers, FP\&A, Treasury, Internal Audit, and founders who want an enterprise-grade finance stack that grows from startup to multi-entity.

**Outcomes to expect (first 30–90 days):**

* Close **2–5 days** faster on in-scope accounts
* **70–90%** auto-match on cash/AR/AP in scope
* Audit packet accepted with **<10%** rework
* **DSO −3 to −7 days** with collections pack
* **0.05–0.5% of AP** recovered/avoided (duplicates/leakage)
* **5–15%** SaaS run-rate savings

---

## What DeepChief Does (plain English)

* **Match the money** every day (bank ↔ books), flag only the oddities
* **Chase the right things** with ranked root-cause hypotheses and proposed fixes
* **Prove the rules were followed** via continuous control tests and signed receipts
* **Explain the swings** with first-draft flux narratives tied to transactions
* **Keep one forecast** that stays in sync with the books and policy constraints
* **Optimize spend** across invoices, duplicates, and unused SaaS seats
* **Hand auditors a clean binder** with PBC self-serve access

---

## Guardrails that keep it explainable

1. **Policy-as-Code**: human-readable rules (limits, thresholds, approvals)
2. **Evidence Receipts**: signed logs of input → tools → output with links to source rows
3. **Human Gates**: read-only ▶ propose ▶ auto-post within limits; approvals above thresholds

## Key workflows

### Close-to-Cash (daily)

1. Pull books and bank feeds
2. Auto-reconcile and cluster exceptions
3. Run control tests and generate receipts
4. Draft flux; update forecast; surface cash actions

### Spend-to-Value (weekly)

1. 3-way-match POs and invoices
2. Flag duplicates/overpayments with recovery packets
3. Audit T\&E against policy
4. Right-size SaaS and contracts

---

## Use cases

* **Faster, cleaner close** for controllers consolidating entities
* **Audit-ready controls** for SOX teams tired of screenshot hunts
* **Cash certainty** for treasury under covenant pressure
* **Working-capital wins** for CFOs focused on DSO, DPO, and discount capture
* **Opex discipline** for procurement targeting SaaS sprawl
* **Founder mode** (DeepChief Start): bank + Stripe + QuickBooks with the same receipts and gates

---

## User stories (selected)

**Staff Accountant — Cash reconciliation**

* *Given* yesterday’s bank feed and GL, *when* I open Reconciles, *then* 80% of items are matched with receipts and only true exceptions remain with proposed fixes.

**Controller — Controls and flux**

* *Given* policy thresholds, *when* the period rolls, *then* control tests run automatically, exceptions are routed, and a first-draft flux narrative is ready for review.

**Treasury — Cash projection**

* *Given* approved invoices and expected receipts, *when* I review cash, *then* DeepChief proposes sweeps and flags covenant risk with evidence links.

**Internal Audit — PBC**

* *Given* the audit plan, *when* I request samples, *then* I receive a packet with signed receipts, tie-outs, and links to source transactions.

**FP\&A — One number**

* *Given* live actuals and constraints, *when* I run the forecast, *then* I see a single truth from books to board, with drivers and policies attached.

## Example policy-as-code

```yaml
policy: AP_EarlyPay_Discount
when: invoice.status == "approved" && invoice.terms == "2/10, net 30"
if: forecast.cash.buffer_days >= 14
then:
  propose: early_payment
  expected_savings: 0.02 * invoice.amount
gate:
  manager_approval: invoice.amount > 25000
receipt:
  include: [invoice_id, terms, buffer_days, expected_savings]
```

**Receipt (abbrev):**

```json
{
  "policy": "AP_EarlyPay_Discount",
  "input": {"invoice_id": "INV-10421", "terms": "2/10, net 30", "buffer_days": 21},
  "tools_used": ["cash_forecast.v2", "erp.ap.read"],
  "result": {"proposed_action": "early_payment", "expected_savings": 418.22},
  "hash": "0x9f8c...c1",
  "signed_at": "2025-09-24T17:05:02Z"
}
```

## Data connectors

* **ERPs/Subledgers:** NetSuite, SAP, Oracle, Dynamics, QuickBooks, Stripe
* **Banks:** Direct feeds or aggregator
* **Apps:** HRIS, CRM, billing, contracts, ITSM for access reviews

*(Initial repo includes adapters and stubs; expand per customer stack.)*

---

## Security, compliance, and governance

* **Least-privilege, read-first** posture; auto-post only within configured limits
* **Immutable evidence receipts** signed and tamper-evident
* **Segregation of duties** checks and access recert support
* **Data residency** and redaction options for PII in receipts

---

## Pilot plan (6 weeks)

**Weeks 0–2 (Shadow):** Connect ERP/banks; run Auto-Reconciler and 3 controls read-only; generate receipts
**Weeks 3–4 (Propose):** Propose fixes, flux drafts, forecast updates; human approvals
**Weeks 5–6 (Guardrailed Auto):** Auto-post within limits; ship audit packet; KPI review and expansion plan

**Pilot KPIs:** auto-match rate, days-to-close, audit rework %, DSO change (if collections pack on)

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome. Please avoid adding opaque logic without receipts or policy hooks. All new agents must emit evidence and respect human gates.
